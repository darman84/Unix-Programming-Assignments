CS 3377 System Prog. in Unix and other Envs.
Assignment 8
Due: Sunday, Oct 24:  11:59 PM (on elearning).

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with system calls read(), write(), and lseek() and library functions fgets(), scanf(), and strlen().

You will write code to add (put()) and retrieve (get()) students record from the given database. The database consists of several students records (defined in sr.h). Every record has an index which specifies the location of the record in the database. For example, record with index 10, is the 10th record from the begining.
The following three files are relevant to this assignment. 
1. ~sxa173731/3377/io/a8.c
2. ~sxa173731/3377/io/sr.h
3. ~sxa173731/3377/io/db.c

Copy these files to your local directory. Complete the code in db.c as specified by the comments in the file. You need to complete the functions put(int), and get(int). 
Do not modifiy a8.c and sr.h. But understand the code in these files.

Submit only complete db.c file on elearning. No need to submit the other two files.

Compile these source files using the following command:
	gcc -Wall -o db db.c a8.c

Then execute by typing
 ./db str
 
If str is not present open() in a8.c will create. If 'str' exists, then it will be not be truncated.

Below is the sample input/output of the program. Note that the records need not be added sequentially. There can be holes in between valid records. Test your program thoroughly.

{babbage:~/3377/io} ./db str
Enter your choice (1 to put, 2 to get, 0 to quit): 1
Enter the student name: Abdul Wallace
Enter the student id: 47678
Enter the record index: 0
Enter your choice (1 to put, 2 to get, 0 to quit): 1
Enter the student name: Lakshmi Wong
Enter the student id: 34980
Enter the record index: 9

Enter your choice (1 to put, 2 to get, 0 to quit): 0

Another run:
{babbage:~/3377/io} ./db str
Enter your choice (1 to put, 2 to get, 0 to quit): 2
Enter the record index: 9
Student name Lakshmi Wong
Student id: 34980
