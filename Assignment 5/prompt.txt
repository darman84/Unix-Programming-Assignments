CS 3377 System Prog. in Unix and other Envs.
Assignment 5
Due: Thursday, Sep 30:  11:59 PM (on elearning).

In this assignment you will write a recursive function in bash that will do a preorder traversal of a given directory and list the contents of the directory and all the sub-directories under it. The behavior of your script should be similar to that of 'ls -R arg1' where arg1 is the directory that needs to be traversed and listed.

NOTE: You are not allowed to use 'ls' or any other command that displays the contents of a directory. You can use echo, pwd, and cd.

To understand how recursion works, see the script file ~sxa173731/3377/scripts/recurse. Execute the script with any number as argument and understand the working of the script. 

Name your script file as 'a5' and submit it on elearning along with the screen shot of the output after executing './a5 ~sxa173731/3377'.

There are empty directories and symbolic links under ~sxa173731/3377. Make sure the output of your script matches that of 'ls -R ~sxa173731/3377'. The format of the output of your script need not match the output of ls.
