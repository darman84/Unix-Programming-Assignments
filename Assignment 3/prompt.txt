CS 3377 System Prog. in Unix and other Envs.
Assignment 3
Due: Thursday, Sep 16:  11:59 PM (on elearning).

For this assignment you have to learn a bit by yourself. Read about 'find' command. I strongly recommend reading the section on 'find' in Sobell's book. Also, look at the man page for find. Understand some examples shown and try them.

This assignment has two parts. Complete both the parts.

1. One of the questions you may be asked in your job interview is the total number of lines of 'C' code you have written. You may have written C programs in many courses you have taken, and they will be in different sub-directories. You can manually look for each .c file and count the number of lines. But as a CS/SE major you need to do better than this. You need to write a command that finds the total number of lines of all the .c files under the current directory and subdirectories below it. 
The testcase you will use is ~sxa173731/3377/xv6.tar.gz. Copy this to your local directory and extract it. (See man page on tar.) You will see xv6 directory and there are several .c files in subdirectories under it. Your command should find the total of lines of all the .c files under xv6 dir. (The total number of lines is 7422.)

2. Next, you will write a command to find the 5 largest files under xv6 dir. Note that you should not consider directories. Otherwise, the output may be erroneous. 
	
Submit the screenshot of the following operations with their output on elearning.
1. Execute pwd
2. Execute the command you wrote for part 1.
3. Execute the command you wrote for part 2.
	
Hint: You need to use find (surprise!). You can ignore the option part of find command. Look carefully at "-exec". Also, look at option for ls that returns the size of the file. Other commands that will be useful are sort, cat, tail/head.
