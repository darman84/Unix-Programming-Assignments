CS 3377 System Prog. in Unix and other Envs.
Assignment 2
Due: Thursday, Sep 9:  11:59 PM (on elearning).

For this assignment, you will write two (complex) commands. In a given text file, you need find the 10 most frequently used words and 10 least frequently used words. Once you write a command to find 10 most frequently used words, you can easily tweak the command to find the 10 least frequently used words. 
You may have to use xargs, grep, sort, and several other commands to solve these problems. Note that each problem can be solved using combination of multiple commands; but all these commands should be in a single line (of any length).
For example,
	sort ypages > out
	uniq out
is not a single line command. Whereas the following is a single line command.
	sort ypages | uniq

You should write two single line commands for the two problems.

While counting the frequency you should ignore these words: 'the', 'an', 'a', 'of', and 'and'. Do not use grep multiple times for this.
Also, while comparing/matching the words ignore the difference in cases. 

Use the file 'story.txt' in shared box folder as input. You can either download this to cs1/cs2, or use copy and paste.
	
Submit the screenshot of the following operations with their output on elearning.
1. Execute pwd
2. Execute the command to find 10 most frequently used words
3. Execute the command to find 10 least frequently used words
